Everything I Know About Love
THE SUNDAY TIMES BESTSELLER WITH A NEW CHAPTER ON TURNING THIRTY
'The book we will thrust into our friends' hands. Alderton feels like a best friend and your older sister all rolled into one and her pages wrap around you like a warm hug' Evening Standard
*Winner of Autobiography of the Year at the National Book Awards 2018* *A Waterstones Paperback of the Year 2019* *A Sunday Times paperback of the year 2019* *Selected for Stylist's The Decade's 15 Best Books by Remarkable Women*
Award-winning journalist Dolly Alderton survived her twenties (just about) and in Everything I Know About Love, she gives an unflinching account of the bad dates and squalid flat-shares, the heartaches and humiliations, and most importantly, the unbreakable female friendships that helped her to hold it all together. Glittering with wit, heart and humour, this is a book to press into the hands of every woman who has ever been there or is about to find themselves taking that first step towards the rest of their lives.

'Deeply funny, sometimes shocking, and admirably open-hearted and optimistic' Daily Telegraph
'A sensitive, astute and funny account of growing up millennial' Observer
